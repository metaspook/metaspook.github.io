Intellimalism by Metaspook

Intellimalism strongly implies a design or operational doctrine where:

Intelligence is the method—using smart design, data, or AI to solve problems.
Minimalism is the goal and result—achieving elegance, clarity, and efficiency through reduction.

"Intellimalism" works very well in contexts such as:

Design Thinking: A philosophy for creating products that are smart in how they work but minimal in how they look and require interaction.
Engineering: The practice of building systems that are robust and "intelligent" internally but present a "minimalist" interface or footprint externally.
Lifestyle: A mindset of using intelligence to simplify life and focus on what truly matters, minimizing physical or mental clutter.
